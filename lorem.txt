You don't come around, to me see in the week
You don't have a chance, to call me on the phone
You don't come around, to me see in the week
You don't have a chance, to call me on the phone
But Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, (daddy's home) weekend special
I'm no weekend, (daddy's home) weekend special
Another lonely night, on my own again
How along for your love
I need your touch, yes I do
You don't come around, to me see in the week
You don't have a chance, to call me on the phone
But Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
I'm your weekend special
I'm your weekend speciaL
I'm no weekend special
That is allâ€¦
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
I know
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
I'm no weekend, weekend special
